## Further improvements I would have liked to have included with more time

-Full testing coverage :
    Testing has only been completed for the Movie class. With more time I would test components and services with full coverage including mocking dependencies and api calls.

- Improve styling and add animations :
    I would add a list animation to the movies list to animate the items in and out when the filters are called.
    I would improve the details page to include more information about the film and use the backdrop image to create a more dynamic design.
    I would improve the details page on mobile.

- Add a loading state for list and details page.

- Add other media types to the site such as TV shows:
  I could then use a base class to create a Movie and Tv Class and share common properties and functionality to demonstrate futher OOP knowledge.
  The UI could then be extended to add additional filters to the media list.
